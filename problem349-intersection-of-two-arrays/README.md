Intersection of Two Arrays II
===

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in __any order__.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.
```

__Constraints:__

1. `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
2. `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`
